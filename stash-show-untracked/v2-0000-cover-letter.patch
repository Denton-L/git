Subject: [PATCH v2 0/9] stash show: learn --include-untracked and
 --only-untracked
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>,
    Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

A blindspot that I've noticed in git is that it's not possible to
properly view a stash entry that has untracked files via `git stash
show`. Teach `git stash show --include-untracked` which should do this.
In addition, this series also teaches `--only-untracked` and the
`stash.showIncludeUntracked` config option.

The first seven patches of this series are just some clean up that I've
done prior to working (because it bothers me). The remaining two patches
should be the meat of the change.

Changes since v1:

* Add a dash for <log-options> and <diff-options>

* Fix the misspelling of --include-untracked in a commit message

* Change the approach from concatenating diffs to using `git read-tree`
