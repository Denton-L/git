Subject: [PATCH 0/2] completion: complete --skip for cherry-pick and revert
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

Before, the completion script would not complete `--skip` for
cherry-pick and revert, even though it is a valid option while that
operation is in progress. Add that missing completion.
