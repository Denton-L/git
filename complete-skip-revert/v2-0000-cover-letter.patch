Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] advertise --skip for cherry-pick and revert better
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>

Hi Junio, thanks for the suggestion. I incorporated your suggestion.
Also, I decided to incorporate another patch (3/3) I was planning on
submitting later since both these patchsets have a common purpose:
advertising the `--skip` option better.


Before, the completion script would not complete `--skip` for
cherry-pick and revert, even though it is a valid option while that
operation is in progress. Add that missing completion.

Also, if a cherry-pick or revert is still in progress, mention the
`--skip` flag in the status message so that users are more aware of
their options.

Changes since v1:

* Instead of outright replacing the old completion variables, make them derive
  from a common variable.
* Add patch 3/3 and change the focus of this patchset so that it's focused on
  advertising the `--skip` option better.
