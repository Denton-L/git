Subject: [PATCH 0/2] completion: teach rebase and archive to use __gitcomp_builtin
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

Currently, the completion function for rebase and archive don't take
advantage of __gitcomp_builtin(). Teach them to use it so that future
changes to options will automatically be included by the completion
script with no extra work.

I discovered rebase wasn't using it and fixed that and I started looking
for other low-hanging fruit to fix. I deliberately left stuff like diff
and log alone since that's a whole Pandora's box that I don't really
want to open right now.
