So this is the first time I've touched the networking code of Git. There
are a few problems with this patch that I'd appreciate some help
addressing.

First of all, is this even the right approach? I tried to find some
other way to force a CGI script to terminate a connection but I don't
think that it's possible so I had to get the client to do it instead.

Next, with this patch applied it seems like t5539-fetch-http-shallow
fails on 'no shallow lines after receiving ACK ready'. I've been trying
to dig into why this happens but I can't quite figure it out.

Finally, I'd like the test case I added in t5702 to be guarded by some
timeout in case we regress instead of blocking the test suite forever
but I'm not sure if that's even available functionality. It seems like
we don't use the `timeout` program yet so I'm not sure if it's a good
idea to introduce it here.

Thanks,

Denton
