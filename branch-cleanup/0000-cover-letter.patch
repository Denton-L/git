Subject: [PATCH 0/3] branch and t3200 cleanup
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

I was looking through some old patches that I had sitting around. In one
set of these, I implemented `git branch --set-remote-to` but I
ultimately decided that the idea was stupid. However, these patches are
salvageable so I'll send them in.

Denton Liu (3):
  t3200: rename "expected" to "expect"
  t3200: test for specific errors
  branch: don't mix --edit-description
