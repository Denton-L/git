Subject: [PATCH 0/2] contrib/git-resurrect.sh: make it hash-agnostic
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

Since Git supports hashes other than SHA-1, the hardcoded $_x40 used to
match OIDs is no longer correct. Replace it with a hash-agnostic
version.

While we're at it fix some indent issues.

There are some other style issues in the script but I'll leave those as
out-of-scope.

  contrib/git-resurrect.sh: indent with tabs
  contrib/git-resurrect.sh: use hash-agnostic OID pattern
