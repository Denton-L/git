Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Makefile: define UPSTREAM_SOURCES
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

After looking through the source files in compat/ and investigating the
files' content and/or its Git history, I've determined the list of files
that were copied from an upstream. Place the names of these files into
the UPSTREAM_SOURCES variable in the Makefile.

In addition, add the sha1collisiondetection/ and sha1dc/ sources as well
since they are also imported from upstream.

In a future commit, this variable will be used to determine which files
are excluded when running the "coccicheck" target.
