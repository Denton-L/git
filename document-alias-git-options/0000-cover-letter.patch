Subject: [PATCH 0/2] document alias accepting non-command first word
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>

When I first saw Johannes' email here[1], I was surprised that an alias
where the first-word is a command-line option to be passed into `git`
was permitted. I was only used to aliases where the first word is a
command.

Document this behaviour so that users will be able to discover that this
is a feature.
