	description = learn the \"summary\" pretty format\n\nOn this mailing list (and many others) the standard way to reference\nother commits with the \"summary\" format, e.g. \"f86a374 (\"pack-bitmap.c:\nfix a memleak\", 2015-03-30)\". Since it's so commonly used, let's\nstandardise it as a pretty format.\\n
