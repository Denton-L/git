[branch "branch-specific-format-patch/v3"]
	description = teach branch-specific options for format-patch\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Replaced `format.<branch-name>.coverSubject` and `--cover-subject`\n  with `format.inferCoverSubject` and `--infer-cover-subject` which\n  reads the subject from the branch description\n* Do not let `git branch -d` delete `format.<branch-name>.*` configs\n* More documentation cleanup\n* Taught format-patch to read `format.<branch-name>.outputDirectory` as\n  well\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Used format.<branch-name>.* variables instead of branch.<branch-name>.*\n
[branch "refactor-4/v3"]
	description = pkt-line: war on magical `4` literal\n\nThere are many instances of the literal `4` in packet line-related code.\nThis series replaces these instances with either functions that can\ngenerate the number or an appropriately-named constant.\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Introduce patch 1-2 so that the string length is used to generate the\n  `4` where appropriate\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Replace some a couple of inline functions with macros that ensure they\n  are string constants\n\n* Use strlen() in one more instance over the PACKET_HEADER_SIZE
