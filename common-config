	description = rebase: fix breakage with `format.useAutoBase`\n\nApparently, this use case has been broken for a long time... Since\nbb52995f3e (format-patch: introduce format.useAutoBase configuration,\n2016-04-26). I'm surprised it's only been reported now.\n\nThis patchset fixes the breakage by teaching\n`git format-patch --no-base` and making rebase use it.\n\nThis patch is based on the latest master since it's such an old bug that\nonly got noticed recently, I'm not sure if it's worth fixing in 'maint'.\nThe series does not apply cleanly on top of 'maint' because it relies on\nc1a6f21cd4 (Doc: add more detail for git-format-patch, 2019-08-27) but\nthe conflicts are relatively minor.\n\nChanges since v3:\n\n* Correct error in log messages more precise by saying that rebases fail\n  in general (even if an upstream is set)\n\n* Change ugly use of OPT_CALLBACK into a more elegant form\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Remove spurious indentation change\n\n* Rebase onto the latest master\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Update some log messages

	description = cleanup for 'dl/range-diff-with-notes'\n\nThis series performs some small polishing touches for the\n'dl/range-diff-with-notes' topic. Notably, we fix an incorrect test case\nname but we also perform some nit-picky cleanup for the range-diff code.

	description = format-patch: improve handling of `format.notes`\n\nIn this email[1], Elijah pointed out that the handling of multiple\n`format.notes` configurations could be buggy. If we had\n`format.notes = <ref1>`, `format.notes = false` and\n`format.notes = <ref2>`, the behaviour is ambiguous. This series uses\nthe way `--notes=<ref1> --no-notes --notes=<ref2>` is handled as a model\nand structures the handling of `format.notes` in a similar manner,\nallowing one `format.notes = false` to override previous configs.\n\nAlso, in the same email, it was pointed out that git_config() should be\ncalled before repo_init_revisions(). In 13cdf78094 (format-patch: teach\nformat.notes config option, 2019-05-16), the order was reversed. This\nseries changes it back such that git_config() is called before\nrepo_init_revisions().\n\nThis series is based on top of 'dl/format-patch-notes-config'.\n\nIt has minor textual conflicts with 'pu'. The merge resolution can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Denton-L/git.git on branch\n'published/published/pu-format-patch-notes-config'.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/CABPp-BF44+6gvZVNimKf-k7AWbOjw3OK-cJeFunNR96wvZGkcw@mail.gmail.com/
