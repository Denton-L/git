	description = t: test cleanup stemming from experimentally enabling pipefail\n\nThese patches perform some general test cleanup to modernise the style.\nThey should be relatively uncontroversial. The reason these tests were\nidentified for cleanup was because they failed under `set -o pipefail`.\n\nI've gotten rid of the RFC part that actually enables `set -o pipefail`\non supported platforms. As Peff pointed out, there are a lot of\nopportunities for racy SIGPIPE failures so that part still needs a lot\nof work to be ironed out.\n\nThose changes shouldn't hold back the first part of the series, however.\nLet's try to get this test cleanup merged in sooner than later so that\nany new test cases done by copy-paste will have their changes\nrepresented.\n\nChanges since v3:\n\n* More commit message update\n\n* Clean up \"apply-one-time-sed.sh: modernize style\" more according to\n  Junio's suggestions\n\n* Clean up the t7700 leftover bits\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Update commit messages according to Eric's suggestions\n\n* Add \"apply-one-time-sed.sh: modernize style\"\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Removed the `set -o pipefail` changes\n\n* Addressed Junio and Eric's comments on the first part of the series

	description = rebase: fix breakage with `format.useAutoBase`\n\nApparently, this use case has been broken for a long time... Since\nbb52995f3e (format-patch: introduce format.useAutoBase configuration,\n2016-04-26). I'm surprised it's only been reported now.\n\nThis patchset fixes the breakage by teaching\n`git format-patch --no-base` and making rebase use it.\n\nThis patch is based on the latest master since it's such an old bug that\nonly got noticed recently, I'm not sure if it's worth fixing in 'maint'.\nThe series does not apply cleanly on top of 'maint' because it relies on\nc1a6f21cd4 (Doc: add more detail for git-format-patch, 2019-08-27) but\nthe conflicts are relatively minor.\n\nChanges since v3:\n\n* Correct error in log messages more precise by saying that rebases fail\n  in general (even if an upstream is set)\n\n* Change ugly use of OPT_CALLBACK into a more elegant form\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Remove spurious indentation change\n\n* Rebase onto the latest master\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Update some log messages

	description = Doc: replace opaque mail archive links with lore.kernel.org\n\nWe reference many mail archives that use opaque links. Even though many\nhave been around for a long time, they may still be liable to go down\n(see Gmane) leaving us with dead links that we cannot reference in the\nfuture. Replace these links with links to lore.kernel.org which use\nMessage-IDs so that if lore.kernel.org ever goes down, it will be much\neasier to find these messages in the future.\n\nMy series is based on top of 'jk/lore-is-the-archive'.
