	description = merge: learn --autostash\n\nAlban reported[1] that he expected merge to have an --autostash option,\njust like rebase. Since there's not really any reason why merge can't\nhave it, let's implement it in this patchset.\n\nThe majority of this patchset is spent refactoring. This is so that the\nactual implementation in merge is done as simply as possible.\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Completely changed how the refactoring was done\n\n* More tests and documentation\n\n[1]: https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/issues/394
