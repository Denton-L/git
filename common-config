	description = merge: learn --autostash\n\nAlban reported[1] that he expected merge to have an --autostash option,\njust like rebase. Since there's not really any reason why merge can't\nhave it, let's implement it in this patchset.\n\nThe majority of this patchset is spent refactoring. This is so that the\nactual implementation in merge is done as simply as possible.\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Change patch 1 to refer to ASCII order[2]\n\n* Make read_oneliner() accept a collective flags arg instead of two\n  separate args[3]\n\n* `git reset --hard` now leaves the worktree clean[4]\n\n* Rebased against 'master' since the base is quite old and a new release is\n  coming out soon\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Completely changed how the refactoring was done\n\n* More tests and documentation\n\n[1]: https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/issues/394\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqwoadfq8n.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqwoaikehz.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com/\n[4]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200123042906.GA29009@generichostname/

[branch "submitted/test-must-fail-fixes-3"]
	description = t: replace incorrect test_must_fail usage (part 3)\n\nThe overall scope of these patches is to replace inappropriate uses of\ntest_must_fail. IOW, we should only allow test_must_fail to run on `git`\nand `test-tool`. Ultimately, we will conclude by making test_must_fail\nerror out on non-git commands. An advance view of the final series can\nbe found here[1].\n\nThis is the third part. It focuses on t5*.sh.\n\nThe first part can be found here[2]. The second part can be found here[3].\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Broke up long generate_references() lines for clarity in 2/8\n\n* For-loop &&-chain and renamed variable to \"ref\" in 2/8\n\n* Cleaned up commit message in 2/8\n\n* Rewrote 4/8 with a simpler test case\n\n[1]: (may be rebased at any time) https://github.com/Denton-L/git/tree/ready/cleanup-test-must-fail2\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1576583819.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1577454401.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/
