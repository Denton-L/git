	description = pkt-line: war on magical `4` literal\n\nThere are many instances of the literal `4` in packet line-related code.\nThis series replaces these instances with either functions that can\ngenerate the number or an appropriately-named constant.\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Introduce patch 1-2 so that the string length is used to generate the\n  `4` where appropriate\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Replace some a couple of inline functions with macros that ensure they\n  are string constants\n\n* Use strlen() in one more instance over the PACKET_HEADER_SIZE

	description = t: replace incorrect test_must_fail usage (part 6)\n\nThe overall scope of these patches is to replace inappropriate uses of\ntest_must_fail. IOW, we should only allow test_must_fail to run on `git`\nand `test-tool`. Ultimately, we will conclude by making test_must_fail\nerror out on non-git commands. An advance view of the final series can\nbe found here[1].\n\nThis is the sixth and final(!) part. It cleans up instances of\n`test_must_fail` that were introduced since the effort began. In\naddition, it finally flips the switch and makes test_must_fail only\nallow a whitelist of commands.\n\nThis series is based on the merge of 'master' and\n'dl/test-must-fail-fixes-5'. In addition, this series was tested by\nmerging with 'seen~1' (to ignore the reftable failures) to ensure no\nin-flight topics will require more changes.\n\nThe first part can be found here[2]. The second part can be found\nhere[3]. The third part can be found here[4]. The fourth part can be\nfound here[5]. The fifth part can be found here[6].\n\n[1]: (may be rebased at any time) https://github.com/Denton-L/git/tree/ready/cleanup-test-must-fail2\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1576583819.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1577454401.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[4]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1585209554.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[5]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1587372771.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[6]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1588162842.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/
