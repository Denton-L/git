	description = t: replace incorrect test_must_fail usage (part 5)\n\nThe overall scope of these patches is to replace inappropriate uses of\ntest_must_fail. IOW, we should only allow test_must_fail to run on `git`\nand `test-tool`. Ultimately, we will conclude by making test_must_fail\nerror out on non-git commands. An advance view of the final series can\nbe found here[1].\n\nThis is the fifth part. It focuses on lib-submodule-update.sh and tests\nthat make use of it.\n\nThe first part can be found here[2]. The second part can be found\nhere[3]. The third part can be found here[4]. The fourth part can be\nfound here[5].\n\n[1]: (may be rebased at any time) https://github.com/Denton-L/git/tree/ready/cleanup-test-must-fail2\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1576583819.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1577454401.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[4]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1585209554.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[5]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1587372771.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/

	description = remote-curl: fix deadlocks when remote server disconnects\n\nThe following command hangs forever:\n\n\t$ git -c protocol.version=2 clone https://github.com/git/git.git --shallow-since=20151012\n\tCloning into 'git'...\n\nThis occurs because the --shallow-since arg is incorrect and the server\ndies early. However, remote-curl does not realise that the server\nerrored out and just faithfully forwards the packets to fetch-pack\nbefore waiting on more input from fetch-pack. Meanwhile, fetch-pack\nkeeps reading as it still expects more input. As a result, the processes\ndeadlock. Original analysis by Peff:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/git/20200328154936.GA1217052@coredump.intra.peff.net/\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Remove fallthrough in switch in favour of just extracting the common\n  call out of the switch in patch 3\n\n* Add more detail in function comment and use `const char linelen[4]` in\n  patch 4\n\n* Implement most of Peff's suggestions[0] in patch 5\n\n* Only operate on stateless_connect() in patch 5\n\n* Add tests in patch 5\n\n* Drop \"remote-curl: ensure last packet is a flush\" in favour of\n  \"stateless-connect: send response end packet\"\n\n[0]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200515213844.GD115445@coredump.intra.peff.net/
