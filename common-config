	description = learn the \"summary\" pretty format\n\nOn this mailing list (and many others) the standard way to reference\nother commits with the \"summary\" format, e.g. \"f86a374 (\"pack-bitmap.c:\nfix a memleak\", 2015-03-30)\". Since it's so commonly used, let's\nstandardise it as a pretty format.\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Replace more references to \"sha1\" with \"hash\"\n\n* Clean up 8/10 by losing the allocation and making the subject less\n  misleading\n\n* Add tests in 7/10 to ensure 8/10 does not change any behaviour

	description = t5520: various test cleanup\n\nLike earlier patchsets, I want to implement a feature that involves\nmodifications to the test suite. Since that feature will probably take a\nwhile to polish up, however, let's clean up the test suite in a separate\npatchset first so it's not blocked by the feature work.\n\n1/15 is a general improvement to test_rev_cmp() that will be used later\nin the series.\n\nChanges since v3:\n\n* Rebased and tested on top of v2.24.0\n\nChanges since v2:\n\n* Drop 't7408: replace `test_must_fail test_path_is_file`' since it's\n  not a rabbit hole we want to go into right now\n\n* Fix the output of `test_cmp_rev !` when revs are actually equal\n\n* Rebase against the latest master since this topic hasn't been picked\n  up yet\n\nChanges since v1:\n\n* Incorporate Eric's feedback
