	description = gitk: match Git's 'reference' pretty format\n\nRecently, the 'reference' pretty format was implemented in Git, which\nhas the same function as the 'Copy commit summary' feature in gitk.\nSince Git now has a canonical way of doing this, update gitk to match\nthis.

	description = t: replace incorrect test_must_fail usage (part 5)\n\nThe overall scope of these patches is to replace inappropriate uses of\ntest_must_fail. IOW, we should only allow test_must_fail to run on `git`\nand `test-tool`. Ultimately, we will conclude by making test_must_fail\nerror out on non-git commands. An advance view of the final series can\nbe found here[1].\n\nThis is the fifth part. It focuses on lib-submodule-update.sh and tests\nthat make use of it.\n\nThe first part can be found here[2]. The second part can be found\nhere[3]. The third part can be found here[4]. The fourth part can be\nfound here[5].\n\nChanges since v1.2:\n\n* In \"lib-submodule-update: pass OVERWRITING_FAIL\", use if-then return\n  to reduce the amount of code churn\n\n[1]: (may be rebased at any time) https://github.com/Denton-L/git/tree/ready/cleanup-test-must-fail2\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1576583819.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1577454401.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[4]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1585209554.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/\n[5]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1587372771.git.liu.denton@gmail.com/
