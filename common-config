	description = cleanup for 'dl/range-diff-with-notes'\n\nThis series performs some small polishing touches for the\n'dl/range-diff-with-notes' topic. Notably, we fix an incorrect test case\nname but we also perform some nit-picky cleanup for the range-diff code.

	description = format-patch: improve handling of `format.notes`\n\nIn this email[1], Elijah pointed out that the handling of multiple\n`format.notes` configurations could be buggy. If we had\n`format.notes = <ref1>`, `format.notes = false` and\n`format.notes = <ref2>`, the behaviour is ambiguous. This series uses\nthe way `--notes=<ref1> --no-notes --notes=<ref2>` is handled as a model\nand structures the handling of `format.notes` in a similar manner,\nallowing one `format.notes = false` to override previous configs.\n\nAlso, in the same email, it was pointed out that git_config() should be\ncalled before repo_init_revisions(). In 13cdf78094 (format-patch: teach\nformat.notes config option, 2019-05-16), the order was reversed. This\nseries changes it back such that git_config() is called before\nrepo_init_revisions().\n\nThis series is based on top of 'dl/format-patch-notes-config'.\n\nIt has minor textual conflicts with 'pu'. The merge resolution can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Denton-L/git.git on branch\n'published/published/pu-format-patch-notes-config'.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/CABPp-BF44+6gvZVNimKf-k7AWbOjw3OK-cJeFunNR96wvZGkcw@mail.gmail.com/
