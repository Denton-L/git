Subject: [BUG/PATCH 0/5] t4214: cleanup and demonstrate graph bug

This patchset cleans up t4214 and then, in the last patch, demonstrates
a bug in the way some octopus merges are colored.

While I was playing around with Pratyush's octopus merge in git-gui, I
noticed that there was a bug in `git log --graph`. The horizontal lines
in the octopus merge seemed to have an off-by-one error in their
coloring. More detail in the last patch.

I tried my hand at fixing the bug but in the hour I spent going at it, I
couldn't fix the logic up. The buggy logic is in graph.c:
graph_draw_octopus_merge() in case anyone is interested.


Denton Liu (5):
  test-lib: let test_merge() perform octopus merges
  t4214: use test_merge
  t4214: generate expect in their own test cases
  t4214: explicitly list tags in log
  t4214: demonstrate octopus graph coloring failure
