Subject: [PATCH 0/3] cleanup for 'dl/range-diff-with-notes'
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

This series performs some small polishing touches for the
'dl/range-diff-with-notes' topic. Notably, we fix an incorrect test case
name but we also perform some nit-picky cleanup for the range-diff code.

Denton Liu (3):
  t3206: fix incorrect test name
  range-diff: mark pointers as const
  range-diff: clear `other_arg` at end of function
