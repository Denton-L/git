Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] fixes related to `make hdr-check`
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>

The first two patches fix errors causing `make hdr-check` to fail. The third is
legacy from v1 but provides code cleanup so we leave it. Finally, the last
patch is a patch which improves the portability and correctness of `hdr-check`.

Changes since v1:

* Reordered patches to put fixes first

* Took Peff's improvement suggestions for the $(HCO) target

* Added "pack-bitmap.h: fix unused variable warning"


Denton Liu (4):
  apply.h: include missing header
  promisor-remote.h: include missing header
  pack-bitmap.h: remove magic number
  Makefile: emulate compile in $(HCO) target better
