Subject: [PATCH 00/12] t5520: various test cleanup
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

Like earlier patchsets, I want to implement a feature that involves
modifications to the test suite. Since that feature will probably take a
while to polish up, however, let's clean up the test suite in a separate
patchset first so it's not blocked by the feature work.

Denton Liu (12):
  t5520: improve test style
  t5520: use sq for test case names
  t5520: let sed open its own input
  t5520: replace test -f with test_path_is_file
  t5520: remove spaces after redirect operator
  t5520: use test_line_count where possible
  t5520: replace test -{n,z} with test-lib functions
  t5520: use test_cmp_rev where possible
  t5520: test single-line files by git with test_cmp
  t5520: don't put git in upstream of pipe
  t5520: replace subshell cat comparison with test_cmp
  t5520: replace `! git` with `test_must_fail git`
