Hi all, since this is general cleanup that shouldn't be too
controversial, I'm looking for some positive acks for this changeset.


Like earlier patchsets, I want to implement a feature that involves
modifications to the test suite. Since that feature will probably take a
while to polish up, however, let's clean up the test suite in a separate
patchset first so it's not blocked by the feature work.

1/15 is a general improvement to test_rev_cmp() that will be used later
in the series.

Changes since v3:

* Rebased and tested on top of v2.24.0

Changes since v2:

* Drop 't7408: replace `test_must_fail test_path_is_file`' since it's
  not a rabbit hole we want to go into right now

* Fix the output of `test_cmp_rev !` when revs are actually equal

* Rebase against the latest master since this topic hasn't been picked
  up yet

Changes since v1:

* Incorporate Eric's feedback
