Subject: [PATCH 0/3] range-diff: don't compare notes
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

When I was using range-diff at $DAYJOB earlier, I realised that it
includes commit notes as part of the commit message comparison. This is
undesired behaviour so this patchset documents it and stops it from
happening.

Denton Liu (3):
  t3206: remove spaces after redirect operators
  t3206: demonstrate failure with notes
  range-diff: use --no-notes to generate patches
