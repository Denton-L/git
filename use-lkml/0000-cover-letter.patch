Thanks for doing this. Perhaps while we're at it, we want to change all
of the MARC and Gmane links as well? The series below does this.

I've based my series on top of yours so if you need to do a reroll, feel
free to pick my changes in.

  doc: replace MARC links with LKML
  RelNotes: replace Gmane with real Message-IDs
