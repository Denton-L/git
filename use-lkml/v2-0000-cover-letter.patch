Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] Doc: replace opaque mail archive links with
 lore.kernel.org
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>,
    Konstantin Ryabitsev <konstantin@linuxfoundation.org>,

We reference many mail archives that use opaque links. Even though many
have been around for a long time, they may still be liable to go down
(see Gmane) leaving us with dead links that we cannot reference in the
future. Replace these links with links to lore.kernel.org which use
Message-IDs so that if lore.kernel.org ever goes down, it will be much
easier to find these messages in the future.

My series is based on top of 'jk/lore-is-the-archive'.

         Since we're now recommending lore.kernel.org, replace marc.info links
         with lore.kernel.org.
     
         Although MARC has been around for a long time, nothing lasts forever
         (see Gmane). Since MARC uses opaque message identifiers, switching to
    -    LKML should be a strict improvement since, even if LKML goes
    -    down, the Message-ID will allow future readers to look up the referenced
    -    messages on any other archive.

         We leave behind one reference to MARC in the README.md since it's a
         perfectly fine mail archive for personal reading, just not for linking
