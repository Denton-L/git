Subject: [PATCH 2/2] RelNotes: replace Gmane with real Message-IDs
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>,
    Konstantin Ryabitsev <konstantin@linuxfoundation.org>,
    Eric Wong <e@80x24.org>

The only references to Gmane that remain are in RelNotes. Although these
are definitely not in active use, they might be of historical interest
for future readers so let's ensure that mail references are more robust.

Replace links to Gmane with links to LKML (which is our new preferred
mailing list archive and has the Message-ID in the URL) and bare Gmane
ID references with Message-IDs.

The Message-IDs were found by searching for "gmane:<id>" on
https://public-inbox.org/git/ and taking the resulting message.
