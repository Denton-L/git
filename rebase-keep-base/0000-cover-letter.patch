Subject: [PATCH 0/3] rebase: learn --keep-base
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>

This series teaches rebase the --keep-base option.

'git rebase --keep-base <upstream>' is equivalent to
'git rebase --onto <upstream>... <upstream>' or
'git rebase --onto $(git merge-base <upstream> HEAD) <upstream>' .

This seems to be a common case that people (including myself!) run into; I was
able to find these StackOverflow posts about this use case:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41529128/how-do-you-rebase-only-changes-between-two-branches-into-another-branch
