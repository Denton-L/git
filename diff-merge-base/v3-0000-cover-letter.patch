Subject: [PATCH v3 00/10] builtin/diff: learn --merge-base
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>

The range-notation in `git diff` has been cited as a mistake since diff
compares two endpoints, not whole ranges.[0]  In fact, the ranges seem
to take on the opposite meanings when compared to range notation in
`git log`.

In an effort to reduce the use of range notation as much as possible,
introduce the `--merge-base` flag, slightly modified from a suggestion
by Jonathan Nieder.[1] This flag allows us to replace the first commit
given on the command-line with its merge base between the first and
second commits. This allows us to gently deprecate the `...` form
entirely, although that is left as an exercise to the reader ;)

One additional bonus is that this flag allows the "after" side to be not
just constrained to a commit (like with `...` notation). It can now be
the working tree or the index as well.

The `--merge-base` name isn't very satisfying. If anyone has any better
suggestions, please let me know.

Changes since v1:

* Implement Junio's documentation suggestions

* Update git diff's usage to include this option

Changes since v2:

* Teach diff-index and diff-tree the --merge-base option as well
