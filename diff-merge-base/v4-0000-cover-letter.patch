Subject: [PATCH v4 00/10] builtin/diff: learn --merge-base
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>,
    Jeff King <peff@peff.net>

The range-notation in `git diff` has been cited as a mistake since diff
compares two endpoints, not whole ranges.[0]  In fact, the ranges seem
to take on the opposite meanings when compared to range notation in
`git log`.

In an effort to reduce the use of range notation as much as possible,
introduce the `--merge-base` flag, slightly modified from a suggestion
by Jonathan Nieder.[1] This flag allows us to replace the first commit
given on the command-line with its merge base between the first and
second commits.

One additional bonus is that this flag allows the "after" side to be not
just constrained to a commit (like with `...` notation). It can now be
the working tree or the index as well.

The `--merge-base` name isn't very satisfying. If anyone has any better
suggestions, please let me know.

Changes since v1:

* Implement Junio's documentation suggestions

* Update git diff's usage to include this option

Changes since v2:

* Teach diff-index and diff-tree the --merge-base option as well

Changes since v3:

* Don't use bitfields directly; extract them to an intermediate variable

* Use explicit literals in diff_get_merge_base() for clarity

* Fix xstrdup() leak

* I misunderstood and thought we wanted to deprecate `...` notation;
  this is not the case so remove all references to "gentle deprecation"
  and don't remove usage text that references it

    -    In order to get the diff between a commit and its merge base, the
    -    currently preferred method is to use `git diff A...B`. However, the
    -    range-notation with diff has, time and time again, been noted as a point
    -    of confusion and thus, it should be avoided. Although we have a
    -    substitute for the double-dot notation, we don't have any replacement
    -    for the triple-dot notation.
    +    The previous commit introduced ---merge-base a way to take the diff
    +    between the working tree or index and the merge base between an arbitrary
    +    commit and HEAD. It makes sense to extend this option to support the
    +    case where two commits are given too and behave in a manner identical to
    +    `git diff A...B`.
     
    -    Introduce the --merge-base flag as a replacement for triple-dot
    +    Introduce the --merge-base flag as an alternative to triple-dot
         notation. Thus, we would be able to write the above as
    -    `git diff --merge-base A B`, allowing us to gently deprecate
    -    range-notation completely.
    +    `git diff --merge-base A B`.
