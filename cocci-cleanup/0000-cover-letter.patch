Subject: [PATCH 0/2] cleanup compat/ sources using spatch
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>

Sources under compat/ were excluded from cleanup using spatch since some
of them were taken from an upstream and we didn't want to modify them so
that merging in future updates would be simpler. However, most of the
files in compat/ were created by us so it should be safe to apply
cleanup to those files.

  mingw: apply array.cocci rule
  compat/*.[ch]: remove extern from function declarations using spatch
