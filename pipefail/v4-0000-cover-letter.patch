Subject: [PATCH v4 00/27] t: test cleanup stemming from experimentally
 enabling pipefail
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>,
    Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>,
    Jeff King <peff@peff.net>

These patches perform some general test cleanup to modernise the style.
They should be relatively uncontroversial. The reason these tests were
identified for cleanup was because they failed under `set -o pipefail`.

I've gotten rid of the RFC part that actually enables `set -o pipefail`
on supported platforms. As Peff pointed out, there are a lot of
opportunities for racy SIGPIPE failures so that part still needs a lot
of work to be ironed out.

Those changes shouldn't hold back the first part of the series, however.
Let's try to get this test cleanup merged in sooner than later so that
any new test cases done by copy-paste will have their changes
represented.

Changes since v3:

* More commit message update

* Clean up "apply-one-time-sed.sh: modernize style" more according to
  Junio's suggestions

* Clean up the t7700 leftover bits

Changes since v2:

* Update commit messages according to Eric's suggestions

* Add "apply-one-time-sed.sh: modernize style"

Changes since v1:

* Removed the `set -o pipefail` changes

* Addressed Junio and Eric's comments on the first part of the series
