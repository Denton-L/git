Subject: [PATCH v2 02/10] pretty-formats.txt: use generic terms for hash
To: Git Mailing List <git@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>,
    Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>

Since Git is planning on upgrading from SHA-1 to be more hash-agnostic,
replace specific references to SHA-1 with more generic terminology.
