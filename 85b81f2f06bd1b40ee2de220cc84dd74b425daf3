I am not familiar with the read-tree code so this attempt at replicating
the read-tree code may in diff_include_untracked() may be incorrect
(particularly the use of the_index?).

Also, I could not figure out how to make unpack_trees() error out in the
case where untracked tree entry contains duplicate entries with the
worktree entry.
