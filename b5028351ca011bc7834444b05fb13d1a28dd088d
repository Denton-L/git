This patch is somewhat conservative. Python 2.7 has been EOL'd (although
it's still in common use). Would it make sense, instead, to say that
Python 3.x (the earliest non-EOL'd version) is the minimum version we
support and it would be _nice_ to support 2.7 as well?

On the topic of Python 3.x, 3.1 has been EOL'd since 2012. Would it make
sense to update this version to 3.5 which is the earliest supported
version of Python?
